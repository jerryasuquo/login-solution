# login-solution

Round #2 assessment: (Expected to take at least 3 working days)

Use your best skills and create a C# or Java solution, that allows a user to register and login through a web service of some sort. You are free to choose the style of web service.

You are also free to choose between a database or a in-memory persistence for these user accounts.

We appreciate structured and easily maintainable code. Best object oriented or functional programming practices is always a plus!

The required properties of the user object is;
A global ID and/or Email, FirstName, FamilyName and some way to store the password in a safe manner.

Upon successful login, the endpoint should return a valid JWT. There is no need to develop a GUI for this assessment, but you are free to do so if you'd like.

Upon completion, expose the source code in a GIT repository and send us the link. 
Note that the assessment must be accessible by bmb@ddfinance.com.

Using Stack Overflow and similar services is great, but please remember to restrict the user of these services, so that the assessment reflects Your programming skills.

================================================================================================================================

Well structured and easily maintainable code. Best object oriented or functional programming practices is adopted!
